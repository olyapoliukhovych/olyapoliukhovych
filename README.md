## Hi, I’m Olya 

Frontend developer with a strong background in communication and youth mentoring. 

Currently focused on React, Next.js, and exploring modern tools.  

## Fun fact

For the past 5 years, I’ve been asked, “How do you think people you work with would describe you?” I’ve always given the same answer without hesitation: curious, resourceful, creative.

To check whether I’m right, you can read their recommendations on LinkedIn :)

For me, the point is not that I don’t evolve or learn new things, but that I stay true to the things I value over the years — and that matters.
